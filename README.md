# Byteworks Assessment
Ńgalaba is a modified version of a previous project by Byteworks(http://ngalaba.com.ng/). I built this project using HTML, CSS and Unsemantic CSS. 
Ńgalaba aims at bringing the market closer to the people. It's a hub where Marketers and consumers meet to buy and sell products making it easier to trade.
This project involves only the redevelopment of Ńgalaba's home page.
